### A multifaceted narrative masterpiece

Just like *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, *1000xRESIST* uses its sci-fi setting to explore a very human story about trauma, resistance, and generational conflict, all anchored by the fundamental inability to fully understand another. This struggle is highlighted by Principal, so consumed by her rage that she is unable to accept the feelings of the mother she desperately craves to please, and Knower, a character misunderstood in her constant struggle to survive, no matter the cost. It is impressive how a game where most characters are explicit clones of each other is capable of demonstrating the many aspects of a single person, making each Sister feel unique despite being a reflection of the Allmother.

The narrative is reinforced by the gameplay, which consists primarily of character interaction and reliving past events through flashbacks. While the gameplay is very light and I would consider it a visual novel, a genre I don’t typically play, the game is carried well by its non-linear narrative and memorable characters. This kept me completely engaged and left a lasting impression.
